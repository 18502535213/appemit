AppEmit  v0.9.8

#  Overview  [中文](https://github.com/appemit/appemit/blob/master/README_zh.md)

Appemit is a lightweight middleware that can be easily extended to communicate  applications (especially browsers) with local programs. The web socket of HTML5 standard is mainly used for calling. The default is asynchronous, and the parameters are transferred in JSON format.

### main features:

 - 1  Play web pages or Flash files containing flash in almost any browser, including swf interactive animations, flv movies, etc.
 - 2  Open and manipulate local files in the browser, such as reading PDFs, create, read, edit Office files, and support JavaScript code operations.
 - 3  Call third-party DLLs, OCX components, as well as system winApi functions, tcc, python, lua, etc. in the browser.
 - 4  Develop a package plug-in for the local hardware DLL driver module to operate and control local card readers, printers, scanners, high-shooting instruments, U shields and other hardware devices in the web page.
 - 5  Communication between applications, such as chat.
 - 6  Embedding the IE kernel web page in Chrome protects the source code, allows you to keep the original ActiveX reading html from being modified, while supporting open source kernelwke and blink.

### Solve the problem with the problem

1) Chrome browsers with an international market share of more than 68% (data source Netmarketshare; more than 25% domestic) will no longer support flash (NPAPI) after December 2020, while Microsoft's edge does not support ActiveX.

2) Customers are used to using browsers to handle a variety of business, can call the IE kernel.

3) Gamers, banks, hospitals, power, hardware, and other enterprise customers using dll, ActiveX, flash and other files need to be required.

### Conditions of use

Windows system, support XP above.
 
### Technology Dependency

- Web Socket uses open source controls [HPSocket](https://github.com/ldcsaa/HP-Socket) to support ssl.
 - The Dll file opens the C interface, where the basic secondary development control is possible.
 - HPSocket4C_U.dll HPSocket4C-SSL_U.dll
- IE kernel calls flash Active control
- Non-IE kernel calls flash NPAPI control
- Webkit kernel with open source software wke control
- The blink kernel uses open source software miniblink controls

##  Getting Started
 
1. Download the AppEmit file compression package (under **/dist** dir，without plug-ins less than 6M) and run AppEmit.exe once. Set boot boot, avoid killing poison software off. Only one AppEmit.exe process can be turned on at the same time.
2. Web page registration gets set cid, clientKey, to obtain permission to connect. Open the html file inside the demo folder or the demo connection on the home page or test with the temporary account cid.
3. In-background initialization of Appemit connection service
    `initAppEmit("ws://localhost:80/appemit?cid=00000-1&sid=1&flag=1")`
4. Set up clientKey authorization, (clientKey is private, after publication needs to be confidentially confused encryption js) initialization data and authorization, etc.

```
var init_AE={
		 "clientKey":"temp-0000000000",  
		  "browser":ThisBrowser,
		  "wsUrl":wsUrl,
		//  "sid":"1",         
		  "gid":"[1,2]",      
  }

  EmitReq_PaOP(init_AE);
  ```
5 Send a command

`startAppEmit('{"emit":"hardWare","Obj":"pc"}') `

6 Turn off command, automatically turn off if app is turned on

`{"emit":"close","Obj":"flash"}  `

Under demo is mainly an example of html,
Including getting pc information to implement the call index.html
As well as playing flash appEmbed.html
